"""Route a stratified sample of town-to-town trips and record what each one traded.

    .venv/bin/python tools/route_census.py --processed data/processed-ne

Three product decisions — where a "little scenery to offer" warning should
fire, whether `pref=0.5` is a sensible default, and whether dropping the `town`
beauty weight helps — were being made from a dozen hand-picked routes, on which
beautiful-miles-per-extra-minute ranged 0.13 to 2.71. This walks ~1,000 realistic
pairs instead and writes the raw per-route numbers, so the distribution can be
re-analysed without re-routing. See docs/route-distribution-study.md.

Deliberately *not* an HTTP client. `/api/route` serialises a 4,600-point
geometry and 86 turn instructions per arm, none of which this reads, so it calls
`Router.route` directly. That is worth about 1.5x, not the order of magnitude
one might expect: scipy's Dijkstra is single-source-to-every-node with no early
exit, so the graph's size sets the cost and the JSON never was the bottleneck.
Single-process on purpose — `server/serve.py` measured four concurrent routes at
1.08x serial, because that Dijkstra does not usefully release the GIL.

Two measurement traps this is built around, both of which have already produced
a wrong answer on this codebase:

1. `Router.route` re-blends every edge score from the caller's beauty weights,
   so `mean_score` and beautiful-km are on a *different scale* under a different
   weight vector. Comparing them across weight settings compares two rulers and
   reverses conclusions. Both are still recorded — they are the right instrument
   *within* one weight setting — but the cross-weight comparison must use
   `scenery_km`, which is thresholded on the raw `c_*` columns and so is
   scale-free, plus minutes and km. Comparing across `pref` at fixed weights is
   fine: `pref` enters the cost, not the score blend.

2. The fastest arm is routed once per weight setting rather than shared, even
   though `pref=0` zeroes the scenery term and the path cannot depend on the
   weights. It costs ~4 minutes and buys a check on 1,000 inputs that the
   assumption holds — `fastest_path_differs` in the summary — instead of an
   argument from reading the source.

Failures are recorded, not dropped: a pair that cannot route because a point is
off the network, because the two ends snap to one node, or because no path
exists is a fact about the product's coverage. The islands are genuinely
unreachable by road and should show up.
