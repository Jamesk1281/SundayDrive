"""How wrong can the turn-by-turn directions be? Measure every way at once.

    .venv/bin/python tools/audit_directions.py data/processed [routes]

"Accurate directions" is not one property, so this checks the separable ways a
route can mislead a driver and reports each on its own. A single pass/fail
number would hide which of them is actually costing anything.

  * **illegal turn** — the route makes a movement OSM explicitly forbids. Checked
    against the raw `type=restriction` relations in the PBF rather than against
    the graph's own `turn_restrictions.parquet`, deliberately: the graph resolves
    those relations to edge rows and drops the ones it cannot place, so checking
    against them would only prove the router agrees with itself, and would score
    a dropped restriction as a pass.

  * **silent fork** — the route passes a junction where another road leaves at
    nearly the same angle as the one taken, and the driver is told nothing. This
    is the failure that does not look like one in a test: every instruction is
    correct, and the driver still ends up on the wrong road.

  * **start and end offset** — routes begin and end at junctions, so the driver
    is told to set off from the corner rather than from where they are.

The PBF pass takes about two minutes and is cached beside the processed data.
