"""Read drive traces recorded by the iOS app and measure how wrong the clock is.

    .venv/bin/python tools/analyze_trace.py data/processed traces/*.ndjson

The *graph's* travel times are free-flow — `length / speed_limit`, with nothing
charged for lights, stop signs, turns or traffic (`SPEED_KMH` in graph.py). That
is known to be optimistic. This turns "known" into a number, and splits it into
the two separate defects it is made of, because they need different fixes:

  * **speed factor** — you do not average the posted limit between junctions.
    Measured as moving speed vs. the speed the graph assumed, per road class.
  * **junction cost** — the graph charges nothing for stopping. Measured as time
    spent stationary, per kilometre and per stop, and then split by *what* the
    car was stopped at: a mapped traffic signal, a stop sign, a turn, or nothing
    identifiable. That last split is the one that decides which fix is even
    possible — a signal is on that road every time you drive it and belongs in
    `graph.py`, while an unexplained stop is congestion that no static data will
    ever predict. Summing the two would bake one afternoon's traffic into the
    graph permanently.

Adding the speed factor and the junction cost together and calling it one fudge
factor would fit this drive and nothing else: they scale with different things
(distance vs. junction count), so a route with twice the intersections needs a
different correction, and only the split can tell you that.

Both corrections landed on 2026-08-15 and live in `router.py`, which applies
them when it loads the graph — so **the numbers here are the uncorrected
baseline, not what the app told the driver.** Nothing in this file reads
`SPEED_FACTOR` or `CONTROL_SECONDS`, deliberately: a measurement that already
had the correction folded in could not be used to re-fit it. For the corrected
error, and to re-fit either table from a new drive, run
`tools/fit_junction_cost.py` over the same traces.

There is a third, smaller question the trace can answer — whether the back roads
are slow because of the corners or because of the climb — reported as measured
speed by grade band.

Each trace is NDJSON, one record per line, written by `ios/Sources/DriveTrace.swift`:

    {"t":"drive","ts":..,"from":[lat,lon],"dest":[lat,lon],"pref":0.6,"weights":{..}}
    {"t":"route","ts":..,"seq":0,"reason":"start","km":..,"minutes":..,"coords":[[lon,lat],..]}
    {"t":"fix","ts":..,"lat":..,"lon":..,"alt":..,"travelled":..,"route":0,"joined":true,..}
    {"t":"phase","ts":..,"phase":"background"}
    {"t":"end","ts":..,"reason":"arrived"}

`travelled` is metres along the route line the fix was matched to, so the slope
of `travelled` against `ts` is real speed at a known place on a known road. That
is the whole measurement; everything below is bookkeeping around it.

Every exclusion this makes is reported, because the dangerous failure is silent:
a phone that stops reporting while the car is stationary turns every stop into a
gap, the junction cost reads zero, and that looks like good news. So the wall
clock is printed next to the measured time, and unaccounted minutes next to
both.

The per-class breakdown needs the built graph (`graph_edges.parquet`); the
signals-vs-traffic split additionally needs the OSM extract (found in data/raw,
or set VICTORYLAP_PBF). Without either, the rest still works — pass `-` as the data
directory.

# A pair of fixes is only usable if the phone was confident about both, they are

# throws data away, so each one is a claim about what would otherwise be wrong.

# Worst horizontal accuracy to trust, in metres. LocationManager already drops
# anything above 65 m; this is tighter because a 40 m fix is fine for "which
# road" and useless for "how fast".
MAX_ACCURACY_M = 25.0

# Longest gap between fixes we'll treat as continuous driving, in seconds. A
# longer one means the app was backgrounded, the tunnel ate the signal, or the
# phone locked — and the distance across it is real but the *speed* across it is
# an average over unknown conditions.
MAX_GAP_S = 20.0

# Below this, the car is stopped rather than moving (m/s). 1.0 m/s is 2.2 mph.
#
# It was 0.5, on the reasoning that this is "faster than GPS drift at a red
# light". That premise is wrong: `travelled` is a per-fix map-matched position,
# and its along-track jitter at a standstill is metres, so a parked car produces
# apparent per-step speeds of several m/s. Measured against the smoothing window
# below, 0.5 recovered a 45 s stop as 3 runs totalling 24 s; 1.0 recovers it as
# 1 run of 40 s, while a genuine 3 m/s crawl still reads as moving throughout.
STOPPED_MS = 1.0

# A stop has to last this long to be one, in seconds. Shorter is a rolling stop
# or two jittery fixes, and counting those would inflate the junction cost.
MIN_STOP_S = 3.0

# Beyond this a stationary run is the driver parking, not the road stopping
# them, and it is excluded from the junction cost, in seconds.
#
# The junction cost this tool exists to fit is time the *road* takes: a signal,
# a stop sign, a queue. A driver who pulls over for lunch, for fuel, or to take
# a photograph is not being delayed by the junction they happen to be standing
# at, and `stops()` cannot tell the two apart from the speed trace alone —
# both are a car at 0 m/s.
#
# Measured on the 2026-08-22 batch, which is why this exists: two stationary
# runs, of 416 s and 761 s, carried 19.6 of the 34.2 minutes of "stopped" time
# across six drives. Both landed in the unexplained bucket — the one the README
# is emphatic must never reach graph.py — and between them they moved one
# drive's headline error from +32% to +59%. Left in, they would have been
# fitted as junction cost and baked into every route in the state.
#
# 300 s and not tighter because the cost of being wrong is asymmetric. Excluding
# a real 4-minute queue loses one sample from a fit that pools hundreds;
# including one 12-minute lunch stop poisons the fit outright. The longest
# genuinely road-imposed stop worth expecting — a freight crossing, a drawbridge,
# a lift bridge — runs to about five minutes, so this sits just past it. Every
# excluded run is printed with its duration and position, because the threshold
# is a judgement and the reader has to be able to overrule it.
PARKED_S = 300.0

# How many consecutive steps the stopped/moving decision is made over.
#
# Not per-step, because at a standstill the per-step delta IS the along-track
# noise: with 2 m of it, half the steps of a parked car read as moving and the
# run shatters into fragments that MIN_STOP_S then discards. Measured on a 45 s
# stop, the per-step test found 3 fragments totalling 10 s; over this window it
# is one stop of 40 s. The window measures net displacement over its own span,
# which is unbiased on a moving car (exact on a constant ramp) and averages the
# jitter down by the span at a standstill.
#
# 5 and not wider: the window cannot resolve a stop shorter than itself, and
# stop-and-go traffic is exactly the congestion signal this tool needs to see.
# At 9, the five 10-second stops of a queue smeared into a single 6-second one;
# at 5 all five are found. Grid-searched over four synthetic drives — one long
# stop, stop-and-go, free-flowing, and a 3 m/s crawl — 5 paired with
# STOPPED_MS = 1.0 is the only setting that gets the stop *count* right in both
# stop cases while inventing none in either moving case.
#
# Only the *classification* is smoothed. `dist_m` and `dt_s` stay raw, so
# distance and time totals are untouched — median-smoothing `travelled` itself
# was tried first and cost 8% of the drive's distance, clipping the ramp at
# every stop-start.
#
# The residual is a known under-count: the window straddles each stop's edges,
# so a stop reads roughly STOP_SMOOTH/2 seconds shorter than it was. Stop
# durations are therefore a floor. That is the right direction to be wrong in
# for a junction penalty, and far better than the 4 s the old clamped distance
# reported for the same 45 s light.

# of the driver. The recorded `off` says so plainly, in metres, and used to be
# printed and then ignored; the forward jump entered `dist_m` as genuine
# distance covered in one second, inflating that step's speed, its class's
# measured_kmh, and the factor prescribed for SPEED_KMH. Because such a step is

# --- what a scenery mark refers to -------------------------------------------
# A `mark` says the driver tapped at a moment. It does not say which road they
# meant, and the two are not the same thing for three compounding reasons: the
# tap is later than what prompted it, the position it carries is the last GPS fix
# rather than that instant, and beauty is a property of a stretch rather than of
# a point. Every constant below is one of those, made explicit so it can be
# argued with — and `_mark_report` re-runs its own headline across a range of
# them, because a conclusion that only holds at one window size is not one.

# How long after seeing something a driver taps, in seconds.
#
# In seconds and not metres on purpose. Three seconds is 40 m through a village
# and 110 m on a highway, so a fixed metre offset is necessarily wrong at one end
# of the range; the mark carries `spd` precisely so this can be converted at the
# speed the car was actually doing.
MARK_REACTION_S = 3.0

# How much road a mark is taken to be about, in metres, ending at the
# reaction-corrected anchor.
#
# 400 m because that is the length of the chunks `score.py` scores, so this is
# one scored chunk's worth of road — the granularity of the thing being judged.
# Picking it to match the model rather than the driver is deliberate: a window
# finer than the score cannot disagree with it about anything, and a much coarser
# one averages a beautiful mile in with the strip mall at the end of it.
MARK_WINDOW_M = 400.0

# How far apart the window is sampled along the route line, in metres. Samples
# are spaced by distance rather than taken per GPS fix so that a minute spent at
# a red light does not weight that junction 60 times over.
MARK_SAMPLE_M = 25.0

# How stale the position behind a mark may be, in seconds.
#
# A mark carries the last GPS fix, not the instant of the tap, and `travelled` is
# that same fix's match — so if the stream had stalled, the anchor is wherever the
# car was when it stalled and the verdict gets charged to that road instead of the
# one the driver was looking at. At 1 Hz the normal age is under a second; five is
# already a stream that stopped, and at highway speed it is 140 m of error, which
# is a third of the window.
#
# Found by driving the simulator, where a parked phone produced marks aged 32 s
# and the analysis read them as verdicts on the route's first metre without a
# murmur — the silent failure this file's other thresholds all exist to prevent.
MARK_MAX_FIX_AGE_S = 5.0

# Generous, because the car stops at the back of a queue, not at the stop line.

# point is where the route changes road, which is the junction itself.

# destination" at the end — none of which is one. Counting them blamed idling at
# the start point, whose coordinate *is* step 0, on "a turn", and _stop_report
# then folded that into the structural share it describes as predictable from
# OSM — corrupting the signals-vs-congestion split the exercise turns on.
#
# Read off the step's `type`, which router.py sends on every step and
# DriveTrace records, rather than off the English. Matching prose was already
# wrong once: rotaries, exits, merges and forks got their own wordings and
# stopped matching a prefix list written against the old ones, so every stop at
# a rotary silently became "unexplained — traffic" and inflated the congestion
# share that CONTROL_SECONDS is fitted around.
