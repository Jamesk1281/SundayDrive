/// the part with all the judgement in it — can be tested without a phone.
///
/// **The schedule is time-based, not distance-based, and that is the whole
/// design.** A scenic route is deliberately turn-dense: measured over 455
/// maneuver legs on six routes, half are shorter than half a mile and 12% are
/// under 100 m. On that profile the usual "in 2 miles / in 1 mile / in 500
/// feet" ladder has every rung already behind the driver at the moment the
/// previous maneuver ends, so it fires three prompts at once or queues stale
/// ones that arrive after the turn. Announcing on *projected seconds to the
/// maneuver* is the only thing that adapts. See `docs/voice-guidance-plan.md`.
