/// Records one drive to disk, so a test drive produces measurements instead of
/// impressions.
///
/// The backend's `minutes` are free-flow — speed limit ÷ distance, with nothing
/// charged for lights, stop signs, turns or traffic (see `SPEED_KMH` in
/// `pipeline/graph.py`). Calibrating that needs ground truth: where the car
/// actually was, when, and how that compares to what the route predicted. The
/// app already computes exactly that and throws it away — every fix, `update`
/// projects the driver onto the route line and gets `travelled`, meters along
/// *this* route. `(timestamp, travelled)` is the measurement; its slope is the
/// real speed at a known place on a known road.
///
/// So this writes one NDJSON file per drive, of six record types:
///
///   - `drive` — one header: when, from where to where, at what preference.
///   - `route` — the line being followed, written again on every reroute
///     (`travelled` restarts from zero, so the analysis has to know).
///   - `fix`   — one per GPS update: the raw fix and its match onto the route.
///   - `mark`  — the driver's verdict on the road they're on. The one record
///     here that measures the *scenery* rather than the clock, and the only one
///     no laptop can reconstruct afterwards.
///   - `phase` — the app going to the background and coming back, so a hole in
///     the fixes can be told apart from a GPS dropout.
///   - `end`   — arrived, or the driver stopped.
///
/// `tools/analyze_trace.py` reads these back. NDJSON rather than one JSON array
/// because a drive that ends in a crash, a jettison or a dead battery still
/// leaves every line before it readable.
///
/// Nothing here may interrupt a drive. Every filesystem operation is best
/// effort, and a failure sets `failure` rather than throwing. But it does not
/// fail *silently*: `failure` drives an indicator on the nav screen, because a
/// recorder that quietly stopped an hour ago costs a whole drive, and the drive
/// is the expensive part.
/// What a driver can say about the road they're on, mid-drive.
///
/// Two options, not a five-point scale, because this is read and answered at 45
/// mph: a scale needs aiming, and aiming needs looking. Two large targets and a
/// haptic tick can be hit with a thumb without taking your eyes off the road,
/// and the aggregate is what the calibration wants anyway — the question is
/// whether the score *ranks* roads the way a person does, which is a rank
/// statistic over many marks, not a precise reading of any one of them.
///
/// The raw values are the trace's vocabulary and part of its contract with
/// `tools/analyze_trace.py` (see `VERDICTS` there, asserted from both sides).
/// "dull" rather than "bad": the complaint about a road a scenic router picked
/// is almost never that it was unpleasant, it is that there was nothing to look
