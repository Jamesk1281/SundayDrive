/// The announcement latch against twelve real drives instead of four-maneuver
/// fixtures.
///
/// `VoiceGuideTests` proves each rule in isolation on synthetic input, which is
/// the right way to test a rule and cannot test a *drive*. This runs the whole
/// of `NavigationModel` over recorded GPS — polylines of 1,300 to 6,700 points,
/// fixes that wander, cars that sit at lights, and the reroutes that made the
/// latch a problem in the first place.
///
/// **Skipped when `traces/*.ndjson` is not there**, which will be most
/// environments: the traces are gitignored because they are a record of where
/// someone drove, so they cannot be committed as a fixture. See
/// `DriveReplay.directory`.
///
/// **Slow — around 70 s.** The cost is real map-matching against real
/// polylines, tens of thousands of times. `-skip-testing:SundayDriveTests/DriveReplayTests`
/// while iterating on something else.
///
/// **What this does not catch, checked rather than assumed.** Two mutations
/// were run against it and *both passed*, so neither is guarded here:
///
/// 1. Keying the latch on the step index rather than the maneuver's place.
/// 2. Clearing the latch on a `merge` as well as an `adopt` — the naive
///    implementation the whole design is arranged to avoid.
///
/// Mutation 2 produces **byte-identical output on all twelve drives**. The
/// reason is `awaitingJoin`: a same-line reply only ever follows the driver
/// leaving the route, the voice is gated off until they rejoin, and by then
/// they have passed the maneuver that would have been repeated. On real
/// driving the off-route gate gets there first, and the latch is defence
/// behind it.
///
/// So the merge/adopt distinction is guarded by
/// `VoiceGuideTests.test_the_same_line_handed_back_does_not_re_announce_anything`
/// and by `VoiceGuideIntegrationTests`' brief stray-and-return, both of which
/// do fail under mutation 2. What *this* file is for is everything those
/// cannot reach: real polylines, real GPS wander, 42 real reroutes, and the
/// two failure modes that only show up over a whole drive — a storm, and a
/// voice that quietly stops.
