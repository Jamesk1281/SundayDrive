/// What the planning screen is holding once a drive is over.
///
/// A finished drive used to leave its whole plan armed — the origin it departed
/// from and the routes computed for that origin — and `RoutePanel` renders the
/// start button whenever a `response` exists. So arriving somewhere handed the
/// driver a button that replayed the drive they had just completed, from a place
/// they were no longer standing. On 2026-08-25 that button was tapped 86 seconds
/// after arriving in Needham and recorded a parked car for nine minutes, and it
/// could not be stopped: arrival is gated on having joined the route, which a
/// car 38 km from the line's start never does.
///
/// These tests are about `RouteModel`'s state after `endNavigation()`, not about
/// progress along a route, so the fixture route below is a bare two-point line.
