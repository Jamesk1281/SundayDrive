# Plan: time-of-day travel times

**Status: decided 2026-08-31 — not built, and deliberately not.** This is a
standing negative result, not a backlog item. The filename says "plan"; the
verdict immediately below says do not build it. Nothing in `pipeline/` or
`server/` was touched. §§4-7 cost the model out anyway, so the numbers are here
if the evidence ever changes — but read the verdict before proposing this again.

## Verdict: do not build this — not on borrowed data

**Three reasons, in order of weight.**

**1. It would be the only unmeasured constant in `router.py`.** Every number in
that file is measured by this project, on these roads, and defended in its own
comment: `SPEED_FACTOR` cites 52 km of trace and argues why one figure covers
three classes; `CONTROL_SECONDS` is fitted over eight drives with leave-one-out
bounds (10.0–13.8 s) and flags `giveway` as a judgement rather than a
measurement; `BETA` and `PREF_CURVE` were swept together over ten routes.
A peak factor taken from FHWA's area-wide Boston index would carry no
measurement, no error bar, and — because that source publishes its numbers as
images (§3) — no way to check it automatically, ever. That is a drop in the
project's standard of evidence, not a small risk.

**2. At the most likely value it is invisible.** The one indicative figure
available is Boston TTI 1.26, a peak factor of 0.92. Applied to the worked
example, that moves the displayed penalty from 43 minutes to 33–36 — a 7 to 13
minute change on a number the user reads as "about forty minutes", during
weekday peaks only. It only becomes material at TTI ≥ 1.5 (MassDOT's own
"moderately congested" band, factor 0.77), which moves it to 18–30 minutes.

**3. Nothing retrievable can tell us which of those is true.** The area-wide
index understates the corridors a fastest route actually uses; the corridor-level
document that would settle it is not on the web (§3).

**What to do instead**

* **Ship the disclaimer.** A line under the fastest ETA saying it does not
  account for traffic. An hour's work, free, honest, and independent of
  everything else here. It does not fix the delta, and that is fine — see below.
* **If the delta bothers you, measure it.** Three deliberate weekday runs at
  17:30 on one expressway corridor, recorded with the existing `DriveTrace` and
  read with `analyze_trace.py`. That is the instrument that established 1.16 in
  the first place; it measures motorway speed factors to a few percent; and
  three runs handle the incident problem that ruined the Wachusett drive, since
  a crash shows up as the outlier. **A measured peak factor would be better
  evidence than anything in this survey, and cheaper than the emails.**
* Then, and only then, §4–§6 is about a day's work. The design below is
  finished and correct; it is waiting on a number worth putting in it.

**What is not in doubt:** the scenic route's own ETA — the number a driver
actually watches — sits at 5.7% error and is untouched by any of this, because
scenic routes hold almost no motorway. Nothing here is a navigation defect.

---

An earlier draft of this file planned a 168-cell hour-of-week profile fitted
from probe data, with agency data requests, an eight-week polling archive and a
six-state New England survey. That was scoped to the wrong question. §8 records
what it ruled out so nobody repeats the survey; everything else is deleted.

---

## 1. Why this might matter

The planning screen shows fastest beside scenic. That comparison — *is the
pretty way worth it* — is the question the app exists to answer, so the delta
between the two is the product's headline number, not an ETA detail.

`router.py:108` says `SPEED_FACTOR = {"motorway": 1.16}`: motorway is driven 16%
over the posted limit, at every hour of every day. Scenic routes barely use
motorway; fastest routes are mostly motorway. So the delta moves with that one
constant, and nothing else in the app does.

Holding the README's measured 71% fastest-vs-scenic gap on 40–90 km trips, a
60-minute fastest route and a 103-minute scenic one — what the app shows as a
**43-minute** penalty is really:

| peak motorway factor | fastest 50% motorway | 70% | 90% |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1.16** (today's model) | 43 min | 43 min | 43 min |
| 1.00 | 39 | 37 | 35 |
| 0.90 | 35 | 32 | 28 |
| 0.80 | 31 | 26 | 21 |
| 0.70 | 26 | 18 | 10 |
| 0.60 | 19 | 8 | −3 |

**Above a peak factor of ~0.9 the app is within a few minutes of honest and this
is not worth building.** Below ~0.7 it is telling users the scenic route costs
four times what it costs. Everything here turns on which is true.

## 2. What is actually known — and what is not

* Off-peak motorway is **1.16**, measured over the 2026-08-14 drives against
  real `maxspeed` tags (97% of motorway km carry one). Not in dispute.
* Pooled travel-time error after the 2026-08-15 corrections was **5.7%** on
  those drives. The model is fine off-peak.
* Surface classes measure within **7%** across the 2026-08-25 drives —
  `secondary` 0.99, `primary` 0.93, `tertiary` 1.05, `residential` 1.10. This is
  why the plan touches motorway and nothing else.
* **The recurrent peak motorway factor is unknown.** Nothing this project has
  measured establishes it.

That last point is the honest state and it is a change from earlier drafts. The
one drive that appeared to measure heavy motorway congestion was a crash — an
incident, not a schedule — and a time-of-day model cannot predict incidents by
definition. It is excluded here and must stay excluded.

The same reasoning disqualifies a single evening at a single count station: a
factor that collapses and recovers within two hours is an incident signature,
and one day cannot tell it from recurrence. **Any number used here must be an
average over many days**, which is precisely what §3 is.

## 3. The gate: read one number, then decide

**Every source below was retrieved and checked on 2026-08-26, not taken from a
search summary.** Three of the four candidates failed that check in ways a
summary would have hidden, so the status column is the point of this section.

| source | what it gives | currency | cadence | **verified?** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MassDOT, *Congestion in the Commonwealth* 2025 Data Update** | Hourly travel-time index per NHS corridor, CY2024 INRIX, averaged over every weekday of the year | 2024 | irregular (2019, then 2025) | **✗ URL 404s.** Search engines still index its text; the file is not retrievable |
| **FHWA Urban Congestion Report** | Travel Time Index per urbanized area, incl. Boston | **Apr–Jun 2026** | **quarterly since 2008** | **✓ downloads** — but the numbers are *images*; the text layer is invisible-mode spaces, so it is **not machine-readable** |
| **FHWA TPM per-UZA page** (`uacc=9271`) | Peak-hour excessive delay per capita, non-SOV share | 2022 | biennial | ✓ machine-readable, but **no travel-time index and no speed** |
| **CTPS Express-Highway dashboard** | Speed index = observed speed / posted limit, per segment | **2019** | ~4-yearly; 2019 is the newest | ✓ exists, but pre-pandemic |

**The previous draft recommended the CTPS dashboard. That was the stalest of the
four**, and it was chosen from a page description rather than from the data.

### 3.1 If this is ever reopened, the gate is a drive — not a PDF

The verdict is that no source above is good enough to put a number in
`router.py`. So the gate is **three deliberate weekday runs at 17:30 on one
expressway corridor**, read with `analyze_trace.py`. That yields a measured
factor with the same provenance as every other constant in the file, and three
runs separate recurrence from an incident.

Before spending an afternoon on that, spend one minute on a prior: **read the
Boston row of the Travel Time Index column in the latest UCR PDF, by eye.**
`ops.fhwa.dot.gov/perf_measurement/ucr/` → newest quarter. It is a table in a
picture; there is no way around looking at it.

Convert. MassDOT and FHWA both define the index against *observed free-flow*
travel time, and this project measured motorway free-flow at 1.16 × the posted
limit, so:

```
motorway peak factor  =  1.16 / TravelTimeIndex
```

Then decide against §1's table: **≥ 0.9 → ship nothing, do not bother driving.
< 0.9 → the drives are worth an afternoon, and §4 follows from what they say.**

**Expect the answer to be "ship nothing."** The one indicative figure found —
Boston TTI 1.26, from a search snippet of the Q3 2024 UCR — gives 1.16/1.26 =
**0.92**, just the wrong side of the threshold. It is unverified and it is
area-wide, which understates the corridors a fastest route actually uses, so the
true number for motorway at peak is somewhat lower. But nothing found in this
survey supports a factor low enough to make the delta badly wrong, and **the
honest prior is now that this feature is not worth building.**

If the UCR number lands near 0.9, get the corridor-level answer before writing
any code: email `planning@dot.state.ma.us` for the 2025 Data Update, which has
hourly TTI per NHS corridor and is the right instrument. That email is free and
it is the only remaining route to the number, since the file is not on the web.

### 3.2 Rules for not shipping bad data

The failure being guarded against is a stale or wrong constant sitting in the
router for years while every ETA quietly leans on it.

* **Provenance in the constant, not in a commit message.** Each band carries
  source, the *data year* (not the publication year), the retrieval date, and
  the TTI it was derived from. A number whose origin cannot be read off the
  line above it cannot be audited later.
* **A staleness tripwire.** A test fails when the recorded data year is more
  than three years behind the current date. It cannot check the *value*
  automatically — the UCR is images — so it checks the only thing it can, the
  age, and forces a human to go look.
* **Bias toward under-correction.** The two errors are not symmetric. Too little
  correction leaves today's behaviour, which is a known quantity. Too much
  invents congestion that is not there and makes the app claim the scenic route
  is faster when it is not — actively misleading, in the direction the product
  is already motivated to exaggerate. **When the number is uncertain, round
  toward 1.16.**
* **Floor the band.** Clamp the peak factor at no lower than 0.6 regardless of
  what any source says, so a misread decimal point cannot triple an ETA.
* **The blast radius is already small, and should stay small.** A wrong peak
  factor moves the fastest-route ETA and the displayed delta. It does not move
  the scenic route's geometry, and it barely moves the scenic ETA, because
  scenic routes hold almost no motorway. Keep it that way: the band applies to
  motorway only, so the number the driver watches for two hours stays anchored
  to the 5.7%-error measurement rather than to a borrowed index.

## 4. The model

Three bands, motorway only:

```python
# router.py, beside SPEED_FACTOR — same load-time application, no rebuild
# Source: FHWA Urban Congestion Report <quarter>, Boston UZA, TTI <x.xx>.
# Data year: <YYYY>.  Retrieved: <YYYY-MM-DD>.  factor = 1.16 / TTI, floored 0.6.
MOTORWAY_BY_BAND = {"am_peak": ..., "pm_peak": ..., "off": 1.16}
PEAK_HOURS = {"am_peak": (6, 9), "pm_peak": (15, 19)}   # weekdays only
SPEED_PROFILE_DATA_YEAR = 20XX      # §3.2 staleness tripwire reads this
```

* **Weekdays only.** Weekends and holidays take `off`. Recurrent congestion is a
  commute phenomenon.
* **Motorway only.** Surface classes are within 7% (§2); giving them bands
  spends that evidence on free parameters nothing measured.
* **`trunk` only if the source separates it** and the number differs from
  motorway. Otherwise leave it on `SURFACE_SPEED_FACTOR` as today.
* **Ramp the band edges over ~30 minutes** rather than stepping. A cliff at
  19:00 makes leaving at 18:55 arrive later than leaving at 19:05, which is
  absurd on its face and also breaks the assumption a shortest-path search
  relies on.
* **`CONTROL_SECONDS` is not touched.** The band multiplies `minutes`; the
  junction term is untouched, and a test asserts it. Folding congestion into a
  per-junction cost would fit one drive and nothing else — see
  `analyze_trace.py`'s docstring.

## 5. Departure time — the one non-obvious part

A 132-minute drive leaving at 17:00 finishes at 19:12, out of the PM band. So
"apply the departure band to the whole trip" is wrong, and with sharp bands it
is wrong by the full width of the band.

**Route choice** uses the departure band: one static cost matrix, the scipy
Dijkstra at `router.py:982` unchanged, zero added cost.

**The reported ETA** integrates forward along the chosen route instead —
`RouteResult.minutes` (`router.py:1374`) already sums `edge_minutes`, a per-edge
array in travel order, so this is a cumulative walk that advances a clock in one
property. It costs microseconds because a route is hundreds of edges, not
750,000, and it removes essentially all of the approximation error.

Full time-dependent *search* is deliberately not built. Measured on a graph
sized like the Massachusetts build: scipy static 88.6 ms, Python static 319.9 ms,
Python time-dependent 391.5 ms. **Time-dependence itself adds 22%; leaving
scipy's C costs 3.6×.** If it is ever wanted, write it compiled or not at all.
The product defect is a *reported* number, and integration fixes reported
numbers for free.

## 6. What lands where

No graph rebuild. `graph_edges.parquet`, `pipeline/graph.py` and the serving box
are untouched.

| file | change |
|---|---|
| `pipeline/router.py:108` | `MOTORWAY_BY_BAND` + `PEAK_HOURS` beside `SPEED_FACTOR` |
| `pipeline/router.py:721` | `_driving_minutes(depart)` — the one place the band divides |
| `pipeline/router.py:739` | `_control_minutes` **unchanged**, and tested for it |
| `pipeline/router.py:868`, `:967` | `_weights` / `route` take `depart` |
| `pipeline/router.py:1374` | `RouteResult.minutes` walks `edge_minutes` with a clock (§5) |
| `server/app.py:150` | `/api/route?depart=<ISO8601>`, default now; **both** routes priced at it |

`depart` defaulting to now means **no iOS change is required to ship** — "leaving
now" is most of the app's use. Sending a departure time for a trip planned in
advance is a later, optional client change; `ios/` is untouched here.

**Optional, free, and independent of the gate:** a line under the fastest ETA
saying it does not account for traffic and that a mainstream app is better for
time-critical trips. Worth adding either way — but it is not a substitute for
§4, because it disclaims the *comparison*, which is the product's thesis rather
than the part that is unreliable.

## 7. Validation, and what is deliberately not validated

* **Off-peak must not regress.** The 2026-08-14 drives sit at 5.7% pooled error
  and are off-peak; the `off` band is 1.16 precisely so they are unchanged. This
  is the only regression risk the change carries, and it is cheap to check.
* **`CONTROL_SECONDS` must not move.** Re-run `tools/fit_junction_cost.py`; the
  pooled 11.5 s / 8.1 s should hold. If it drifts, congestion is leaking into
  the junction term.
* **The data ages, and nothing will tell you.** The UCR publishes numbers as
  images, so no automated check can compare the constant against the current
  quarter. The staleness tripwire (§3.2) checks the recorded data year instead
  and fails at three years, which is the most an automated test can do here.

* **The peak band is not validated by anything in the trace set, and cannot be.**
  There is no clean recorded peak-hour motorway drive — the one that looked like
  it was a crash. Say so in the constant's comment.

The cheap fix for that, if the gate passes and the number matters: **record two
or three deliberate drives on the same expressway corridor at 17:30 on
weekdays.** That is the only thing that would turn the peak band from a borrowed
number into a measured one, it costs an afternoon, and it should be scheduled at
the same time the constant lands rather than left implicit.

Tripwires, in `tests/test_calibration.py`'s style: every band within `[0.4, 1.4]`
and never below the 0.6 floor;
the `off` band exactly reproduces today's ETAs; band edges continuous within a
bounded step; `CONTROL_SECONDS` invariant to `depart`; a long trip priced by
integration differs from the flat departure-band price, so §5 is provably wired
in rather than quietly bypassed.

## 8. Ruled out — do not re-survey

Recorded so this ground is not covered twice. All were checked at source on
2026-08-26.

* **NPMRDS** — free and exactly the right shape, and **legally unusable**. Its
  Data Sharing Agreement is signable only by a state DOT or MPO receiving
  federal transportation funds, and forbids making "data sets or aggregated
  average travel time databases publicly available" — which is what shipping a
  speed profile in a public app is. Two independent blockers.
* **Scraping the state count portals** (`*.ms2soft.com`, used by MA, NH and VT).
  MS2's terms of use forbid it in terms that name both the verb and the data:
  no "copy, use … download … 'scrape', 'mine' … including without limitation
  traffic data … without the prior written authorization of MS2", and they state
  that this covers the public agency portals. The data behind it is genuinely
  excellent — MassDOT has 214 permanent Interstate stations with 15-minute speed
  bins and years of history — and MS2's own terms say the *agency* owns it, so
  asking MassDOT is the legitimate route if this scope ever grows.
* **MassDOT GoTime API** — free, sanctioned, accepts individual developers, and
  measures true Bluetooth segment travel times. The right source for a bigger
  version of this feature, and overkill for three constants: it is real-time
  only, so it needs ~8 weeks of self-polling before it can be fitted at all.
* **Federal TMAS** — publishes volume and class for every state, never speed.
  Checked at `fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tables/tmasdata/`.
* **TomTom Traffic Stats, HERE Traffic Patterns** — right shape, quote-only
  pricing. Out on cost.
* **Sampling Google/Mapbox/HERE/TomTom routing APIs offline** — would fit inside
  free tiers, and all four bar caching and derivative datasets. The idea that
  looks like cleverness and is a licence breach.
* **Uber Movement** (discontinued, pre-pandemic, wrong roads), **OpenStreetMap**
  (no traffic data at all), **New England expansion** (three portal vendors
  across six states, six separate asks — not a prerequisite for fixing
  Massachusetts).
* **Fitting anything on this project's own eight drives.** One driver, three
  afternoons, and one of those was an incident. They validate; they do not fit.
