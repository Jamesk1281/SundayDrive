"""Run the Victory Lap routing API.

Uses waitress — a production WSGI server that runs the same on Windows, macOS,
Linux, and in Docker (unlike gunicorn, which is Unix-only). One worker process
with a few threads: the ~1 GB graph is loaded once, and the threads keep the
server responsive (accepting connections, serving /api/health) while a route is
being computed.

They do NOT make routing parallel. This used to claim scipy releases the GIL
during the Dijkstra, so requests overlapped; measured on the real graph, four
concurrent routes take 0.482 s against 0.519 s for four serial ones — a 1.08x
speedup, i.e. essentially serialized. Real throughput is therefore about one
route per ~95 ms of CPU (~5 req/s for the two-Dijkstra endpoint), not 4x that.
Going faster means more *processes*, and each one is another ~1 GB copy of the
graph — the trade to make deliberately, not to assume away.

    python server/serve.py                          # 0.0.0.0:5057

    VICTORYLAP_HOST=127.0.0.1 python server/serve.py    # localhost only

Importing `app` below loads the graph immediately, so the server is warm before
it accepts the first request.
