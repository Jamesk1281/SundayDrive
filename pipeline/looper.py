"""Scenic loops: one start point, a distance target, and a different loop each press.

The user gives a start and a length. There is no destination, so this module's
whole job is choosing the geography — which `docs/loop-routes-design.md` measures
as the term that decides whether a drive is good.

Why this is not `router.route(start, start)`
--------------------------------------------
That returns a zero-length route, and correctly so: the router minimises a sum
that accumulates with distance, so the cheapest way back to where you started is
not to leave. Hitting a distance *target* while collecting scenery is the
Orienteering Problem, which is NP-hard. What makes it tractable here is the
router's biggest inefficiency:

    `route()` runs a full-graph Dijkstra with no target early-exit.

For point-to-point that is pure waste. Here it is the entire architecture. One
pass from the start settles every node in the state, and — the measured result
this module is built on — the shortest-path *tree* it hands back can be walked to
recover the exact km and collected scenic-km to all 313,950 nodes, for about
80 ms of vectorised arithmetic. See `_accumulate`. So one pass yields 313,950
costed candidate turnarounds, and re-filtering all of them when the user moves
the distance slider takes 1.1 ms.

The shape of a loop
-------------------
1. Cache two fields per (start, pref, weights): the cost/km/scenic-km *out* to
   every node, and the same *back* from every node (§`_fields`). Two passes,
   about half a second.
2. Filter and rank candidate turnarounds — free, 1.1 ms (§`candidates`).
3. For a chosen turnaround, reuse the cached outbound path and run **one** more
   Dijkstra home with the roads just driven made three times more expensive
   (§`_build`). About 140 ms.

Step 3 is the one that makes this a loop rather than an out-and-back. Measured
over three starts at a 40 km target, the share of loop km spent driving a road
already driven:

    plain out-and-back      Needham 26%   Petersham 50%   Boston 18%
    with the penalty        Needham  0%   Petersham  0%   Boston  0%

Petersham at 50% is the arithmetic maximum — a rural start where the way home is
the way out, reversed. One extra pass removes it entirely for about 0.15 points
of mean score.

Those three are one turnaround each, chosen for scenery. What `plan` actually
ships is chosen for *distance*, which is a different candidate: over three starts
and three targets it comes out at 1.1% repeated road on average and 3.4% at
worst. Not zero, and the difference is `SPAN_PICKS` — see there.

The penalty is soft (a multiplier) and never a ban, and that is not a
preference. 53,216 of 310,162 junctions — **17.2%** — are dead ends, and a house
on a cul-de-sac has *no* loop that avoids driving its own street twice. A hard
edge-disjointness constraint, which is the textbook way to get a non-retracing
circuit, returns "no loop" for every one of them. Sampled five at random: all
five failed hard and all five worked at x3.

What `pref` does here, and why the tab should not offer it
----------------------------------------------------------
Less than it does point-to-point, and not monotonically. Measured at 40 km
targets from two starts:

    pref      0.00   0.25   0.50   0.75   1.00
    Needham   4.76   5.41   5.67   5.73   5.74     score
              2.3    4.1    7.0    8.7    8.7      km >= 7
    Concord   5.86   5.86   4.99   6.15   6.19     score
              9.2    9.2    7.6   11.3    9.9      km >= 7

The endpoints behave — pref 1.0 is clearly better than pref 0.0, on both
measures, from both starts. The dip in the middle is real, and *which* pref
dips depends on the start: Concord loses 0.87 at pref 0.5, and Needham used to
lose 1.42 at pref 0.25 before the forest component was rebuilt on measured tree
cover (it read 5.00 / 3.58 / 5.43 / 5.84 under the old `c_green`). Do not read
the dip as living at a particular slider position. It has two causes, both
structural rather than a bug to chase: candidate turnarounds are ranked by
scenery whatever `pref` is, so a middling pref moves the choice of *where to go*
without buying the routing that would justify it; and the final choice among the
built loops is made on distance and repeated road with no scenery term (see
`_miss`), which is harmless at pref 1.0 where every candidate is pretty and is
not below it.

There is also a cache reason: `pref` is the one parameter that invalidates the
two cached passes, where the distance slider does not. So the loop tab should
pin pref at 1.0 and let the distance slider and the regenerate button be the
controls. Anyone who wants to expose it should sweep it first.

Nothing here changes the router or its objective. Every number above is at the
shipped `BETA` and `PREF_CURVE`. The distance target does quietly repair the
objective's known defect, though, and it is worth knowing why: at *fixed* total
km, minimising the router's `sum of km*(1 - score/10)` is exactly maximising
`sum of km*score`, because `sum of km` is a constant. The length-shrinking
pathology in `docs/scenery-cap-options.md` is a property of letting length float.
Here the slider pins it. Only at candidate selection, though, not inside the
search — which is why these loops reach far out and come back rather than
rambling in a circle.

# distance accuracy to save 0.4% of retrace.
