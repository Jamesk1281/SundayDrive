"""Extract drivable roads and scenic-relevant features from an OSM PBF.

Reads a Geofabrik state extract and writes GeoParquet layers:
  roads          - drivable ways (LineString) with highway/name/ref/scenic/surface,
                   where `scenic` is scenic=yes OR membership of a designated
                   scenic-byway route relation (see BYWAY_NETWORKS)
  access_ways    - highway=service (parking aisles, driveways) with a component id
  access_entries - where each of those components meets the drivable network
  water_areas    - lakes, reservoirs, bays (MultiPolygon)
  water_lines    - rivers and canals (LineString)
  coastline      - natural=coastline ways (LineString)
  green_areas    - woods, forests, parks, reserves (MultiPolygon)
  farm_areas     - farmland, orchards, meadows (MultiPolygon)
  viewpoints     - tourism=viewpoint (Point)
  place_points   - city/town/village/hamlet/square centers (Point)
  urban_areas    - retail and commercial districts / downtowns (MultiPolygon)

# E^1.20 latency scaling in the README). They are extracted for one purpose —
# working out where a destination inside one is actually entered from.
#
# The defect that made this necessary, measured on the drives of 2026-08-22: a
# pin dropped on a building in a parking lot snaps to whichever *public* road is
# nearest as the crow flies, which is routinely the wrong side of the building.
# Three of five destinations were inside mapped lots, and two of those snapped
# to a road with no connection to the lot at all — one to a cul-de-sac 102 m
# away whose only real entrance was a secondary road 226 m away in the other
# direction. The driver was sent on a 3.2 km loop past the entrance they wanted.

# Scenic byways live in OSM as route *relations*, not as way tags. The
# `scenic=yes` way tag read below is nearly dead data — 28 ways in all six New
# England states (MA 0, VT 0, RI 0, NH 3, ME 3, CT 22) — while the relations
# admitted below carry 38 designated routes, 4,510 drivable member ways and
# 3,235 km: VT 1,461, MA 738, NH 639, ME 283, CT 54.
#
# A relation is admitted when it is a *road* route and is *designated* scenic:
#
#   route=road  AND  (network in BYWAY_NETWORKS  OR  scenic=yes on the relation)
#
# Both halves of that OR are load-bearing. Not one of the 14 `US:MA:Scenic`
# relations carries `scenic=yes`, so without the network clause the home state
# goes to zero. And New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island and Connecticut have no
# byway network at all: their byways — Kancamagus, Acadia All-American Road,
# Old Canada Road, Rangeley Lakes, Schoodic, Connecticut Route 169, White
# Mountain Trail — are network-less relations tagged `scenic=yes`, so without
# the tag clause four of the six states go dark.
#
# `route=road` is what keeps footpaths off the roads, and it is not cosmetic.
# Four hiking routes and two cycle routes carry "scenic" in their names, and
# where they road-walk they share ways with the drivable network: 206 ways and
# 91 km of ordinary road, 132 ways of it under the New England National Scenic
# Trail alone. Selecting on the word "scenic" would flag every one of them.
# The same clause drops three railway/train routes ("Conway Branch",
# "Milford & Bennington Railroad", "Winnipesaukee Railway").
#
# Networks are allowlisted by name rather than pattern-matched because three of
# the networks containing a scenic-sounding relation are general
# numbered-highway systems: US:US (56 relations, 18,692 ways), US:ME (187 /
# 7,523) and US:RI (62 / 3,300). Allowlisting those would designate every US
# and state highway in the region a scenic byway. Their three candidates are
# rejected individually and on their own evidence: both Rhode Island Route 1A
# relations hedge in their own tags ("sometimes signed with 'SCENIC' in the
# shield", "sometimes bannered as scenic, and sometimes not"), and Maine SR 11
# is merely *named* "Aroostock Scenic Highway" — 615 ways and 655 km, the
# largest single candidate in the region, carrying no scenic designation tag.

# Counts are from the 2026-08-25 New England extract; see
