"""Score every drivable road chunk in the region for scenic quality.

Scoring components (the per-segment "beauty vector"):
  water   - proximity to lakes/reservoirs/rivers
  coast   - proximity to the ocean coastline
  forest  - OSM woods/forests/parks/reserves, blended half-and-half with
            measured tree cover from landcover.py
  curves  - heading change per km (twistiness)
  relief  - local terrain relief from elevation.py (hills, valleys, overlooks)
  farm    - adjacency to farmland/orchards/meadows
  views   - proximity to mapped viewpoints
  scenic  - designated scenic byway (OSM route relation, or scenic=yes)
  urban   - proximity to town/village centers and retail/commercial districts

The relief component is read from data/processed/relief.tif if present
(run elevation.py first); the tree-cover half of forest from
data/processed/tree_cover.parquet (run landcover.py first). Either one missing
degrades its component to zero and prints a notice.

Each chunk keeps its component vector (the per-segment "beauty vector")
plus a composite 0-10 score. Output: scored_chunks.parquet.

Usage: python score.py <processed_dir>

# per chunk, in line with every other layer — it is polygon vertex count: 88 MB
# and 171 MB of parquet against farm_areas' 16 MB.
#
# Three queries rather than two, because water is queried *twice* and the
# second one is not free. docs/component-rebuild-cache-brief.md's table carries
# one row per layer and prices water at its 350 m query alone; measured on the
# 942,448-chunk New England build, the 120 m query costs 123.4 s against the
# 350 m query's 125.3 s. So the water layer is about twice what that table
# implies — and the five uncached layers, 7.5 s between them, really are the
# rounding error it makes them out to be (place has a second unlisted query
# too, and it is 0.5 s).
#
# So this caches those two layers and nothing else. Wrapping the cheap five in
# hash-and-verify machinery would save seconds and add another place for the
# misalignment hazard in chunk_digest to happen.
#
# Cached at the *query* rather than at the finished `c_` column, because a
# query's inputs are strictly narrower than its column's, in two ways that both
# matter for the constant sweeps this exists to make affordable:
#
#   * `c_forest` is half OSM green and half measured tree cover, and only the
#     green half is expensive. Keying on the column would throw that query
#     away every time landcover.py rewrote tree_cover.parquet.
#   * `c_water` is two queries against one tree, so re-tuning DIST["water_mid"]
#     leaves the 120 m answer alone.
#
# What is deliberately *not* in the key is the point of the whole change:
# WEIGHTS, RAW_BASE, STRETCH and CLASS_ADJ reach none of these queries, so
# re-blending is a cache-hit rebuild. tests/test_cache.py asserts that, and the
# rest of the invalidation table, row by row.

    # ways (docs/unpaved-and-urban-verdict.md):
    #
    # 1. It contradicted this file's own measurements. In all six New England
    #    states unpaved chunks score *higher* raw beauty than the rest, and it
    #    holds within road class — Massachusetts, where the -0.25 was
    #    calibrated, runs +0.063 raw (about +0.76 points after STRETCH) and was
    #    then docked 2.5. The blend above already says these roads are pretty.
    # 2. It measured mapping diligence. The penalty can only fire where somebody
    #    tagged `surface`, and coverage runs from Vermont's 90.1% down to
    #    Maine's 35.9% — so Maine, whose true unpaved share is an estimated
    #    35.4%, was charged for 12.8% and kept 0.57 points that Vermont could
    #    not. Same defect as `c_green` measuring land designation.
    # 3. Sitting in the score put it inside the router's cost function, scaled
    #    by `pref**PREF_CURVE` — so wanting *more beauty* bought *more dirt
    #    avoidance*. See UNPAVED_AVOID_MIN_PER_KM in router.py, which is where
    #    the preference lives now.
    #
    # A driver who does not want dirt roads is expressing a real preference and
    # still gets one; it is a slider, and it is no longer a statement about
    # scenery. Kept as a 0/1 float rather than a bool because graph.py
