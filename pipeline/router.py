"""Scenic routing over the annotated road graph.

Loads graph_edges/graph_nodes, expands directed edges (honoring oneway), and
runs a Dijkstra whose edge weight blends travel time with an "unscenic" penalty:

    weight = minutes + pref**PREF_CURVE * BETA * km * (1 - score/10)

where `minutes` is driving time at the class's *measured* speed plus the time
lost to the traffic signals and stop signs on that road in that direction — not
the free-flow number stored in the graph. See SPEED_FACTOR and CONTROL_SECONDS.

The penalty is a minutes-equivalent cost charged per kilometer of *unscenic*
road (BETA min/km at full ugliness), so the router trades extra distance for
beauty instead of only shaving seconds. `pref` (0..1) is the overall scenery
strength: 0 gives the fastest route, 1 leans hard into scenery.

The per-edge `score` is computed *live* from the road's beauty vector so the
user can weight beauty types differently (see BEAUTY_TYPES) — e.g. favor coast
and town centers, ignore farmland. At neutral weights (all 1.0) the live score
exactly reproduces the precomputed composite from score.py. The same graph
answers fastest vs scenic, so we return them side by side with a breakdown.

Given the date (`on`), the roads OSM marks closed for the season that day are
priced at +inf, from seasonal_closures.parquet (pipeline/closures.py).

# Minutes-equivalent penalty per km of fully-unscenic road at pref=1.
#
# Raised from 7.0 when travel time stopped being free-flow. This is a cost in
# *minutes*, competing against a `minutes` term that grew — scenic back roads
# got slower and picked up the stop signs on them, while motorways got 16%
# faster and carry almost none — so the same 7.0 bought measurably less detour
# than it used to. Measured over 20 routes, the share of a pref-0.25 route that
# leaves the fastest road fell from 70% to 50% and the scenery it found fell
# from 4.62 to 3.39 on the 0-10 scale: the slider's bottom half had gone soft.
#
# Read that as calibration, not preference: `pref` means the same thing to a
# driver as it did before, and it takes a bigger number to mean it now.
#
# BETA and PREF_CURVE are **one calibration** and have to be swept together —
# raising BETA alone fixes the bottom of the slider by handing the whole gain to
# it. Over 10 routes, the share of the total scenery gain won by pref 0.25 and
# by the back half (0.5 -> 1.0):
#
#     BETA  curve    bottom   top          BETA  curve    bottom   top
#      8.0   1.30      0.68  0.07          10.0   1.30      0.77  0.05
#      8.0   1.60      0.35  0.11          10.0   2.00      0.34  0.12
#      8.0   2.00      0.32  0.15          12.0   2.00      0.35  0.10
#
# 8.0 with a curve of 2.0 is the most even the pair can be made. Nothing reaches
# a flat 0.25/0.25 and nothing will: the penalty saturates, so past pref ~0.5
# the router has already taken every detour worth taking, and the ceiling is
# 5.6 on the 0-10 scale whatever these are set to.
BETA = 8.0

# **Re-swept 2026-08-29, when surface left the score, and deliberately left
# alone.** Moving `UNPAVED_ADJ` out raised the region's mean score (4.57 -> 4.87
# length-weighted), which weakens `km * (1 - score/10)` and so weakens BETA for
# the same slider position. Re-running the sweep above, before against after,
# with the same ten routes:
#
#            New England routes        Massachusetts routes
#            bottom   top              bottom   top
#   before     0.21  0.51                0.14  0.21
#   after      0.14  0.59                0.14  0.21
#
# **Massachusetts does not move at all** — to two decimals, identically — which
# is the whole reason not to touch this. The shift is confined to routes that
# have dirt roads on them, and raising BETA is a global instrument: it would
# re-shape every route in six states to compensate for something that only
# happens in two. Restoring the New England bottom would take BETA ~10.0, a 25%
# raise, and the table above already records 10.0 as measured and rejected.
#
# Read the softer bottom as the new behaviour rather than as drift. The surface
# avoidance does not scale with `pref`, so at pref 0.25 it runs at full strength
# against a scenery term that is barely awake — which is the point (a driver on
# the fastest setting can now avoid dirt at all) and costs the slider some of
# its low-end travel in dirt country. A driver who wants that back sets
# `avoid_unpaved=0`.
#
# Note also that the `before` arm does not reproduce this file's own 0.32/0.15
# either. That table was fitted on a Massachusetts build several rebuilds ago —
# c_forest, the relief rescale and the New England extract have all landed
# since. **Do not re-fit against 0.32/0.15 without first re-deriving it**, and
# see docs/unpaved-and-urban-verdict.md for what a real re-fit needs.

# --- Travel time --------------------------------------------------------------
# `graph_edges.minutes` is free-flow — length over the speed limit, with nothing
# charged for stopping. Measured against two recorded drives it ran 22% short of
# the clock. The two corrections below close that, and are applied here at load
# rather than baked into the parquet for two reasons: `tools/analyze_trace.py`
# reads `length_m / minutes` as the speed the graph assumed, so a pre-corrected
# column would have every future drive report a factor of 1.00 whether or not
# the correction was any good; and re-fitting these as drives accumulate is then
# a constant and a restart, not a 135 s rebuild plus copying 80 MB to the
# serving box. See docs/junction-timing-plan.md §5.

# Measured moving speed over the posted limit, with stopped time excluded (that
# is priced separately below). From 63 km of trace on 2026-08-14.
#
# **One number, because the roads agree.** Fitted per class, the surface roads
# came out 0.86 / 0.89 / 0.93 for primary / tertiary / secondary, which looks
# like three facts about three kinds of road. It was not: `SPEED_KMH` had the
# posted limits wrong by different amounts on each, and the factor was quietly
# absorbing that. With the limits read off the tagged roads instead (see
# graph.py) the same traces give **0.94 / 0.94 / 0.95** — the same number three
# times, from 52 km of driving.
#
# That is worth more than three fitted constants. It generalises: `residential`
# has 0.9 km of trace behind it and 41,348 km of network, and a rule backed by
# every class that *was* measured is better evidence for it than its own noise
# (which says 1.16, and which is a tenth of a percent of the drive). Anything
# not named below gets the surface-road number.
#
# Motorway is the one real exception and stays measured: drivers exceed the
# posted limit by 16%, and 97% of motorway km carry a real `maxspeed` tag, so
# that is measured against the sign rather than against a fallback. An ETA
# predicts what the driver will do, not what the sign says.
SPEED_FACTOR = {"motorway": 1.16}
SURFACE_SPEED_FACTOR = 0.95

# --- Unpaved roads -----------------------------------------------------------
# Minutes a driver is assumed willing to spend to avoid one km of dirt road, at
# the default setting. Multiplied by the request's `avoid_unpaved` (0..2, 1.0 =
# this number) and added to the Dijkstra weight *outside* the `pref` term.
#
# **Outside `pref` is the whole point.** This used to be `UNPAVED_ADJ = -0.25`
# inside the scenery score, which put it inside
# `pref**PREF_CURVE * BETA * km * (1 - score/10)` — so it charged
# `pref**2 * 8.0 * 0.25` min/km, i.e. **0.00 at pref 0 and 2.00 at pref 1**.
# A driver on the fastest setting got no dirt avoidance at all, and a driver
# asking for maximum beauty got the most: raising the slider from 0.5 to 1.0
# removed two thirds of the dirt from a Vermont loop (23.7% -> 8.2% of loop km,
# 40 km loops from six Vermont starts). Wanting scenery and minding a dirt road
# are different questions and now have different controls.
#
# **1.0 rather than 0.** The beauty evidence says these roads are pretty
# (docs/unpaved-and-urban-verdict.md) but it is evidence about scenery, not
# about what drivers want, and there is not one drive mark on unpaved road in
# `traces/`. So this is set to preserve behaviour, not to change it: over the
# same loops 1.0 min/km gives 15.0% / 17.2% dirt at pref 0.5 / 1.0 against the
# old constant's 23.7% / 8.2% — mean 16.1% against 16.0%. Same average
# exposure, no longer wired to the wrong knob. Re-fit it against marks from
# Vermont dirt country when there are any; that measurement is specified in the
# verdict doc and is the one thing that would justify moving it.
UNPAVED_AVOID_MIN_PER_KM = 1.0

# Ceiling on the request's multiplier. 2.0 reproduces the old constant's
# strength at pref 1.0, which is the hardest this has ever avoided dirt.
MAX_AVOID_UNPAVED = 2.0

# Seconds lost per traffic control *met* — P(stop) and the delay when you do
# stop, folded into the one number a static graph can charge. Fitted by
# `tools/fit_junction_cost.py` over all eight recorded drives: signals were met
# 127 times for 47 stops averaging 31.3 s, stop signs 18 times for 11 stops
# averaging 13.3 s.
#
# These are an average over a quiet hour and a busy one, and that is the most a
# static graph can be. The spread is real and it is the reason to pool: fitting
# a single drive alone gives anywhere from 2.7 s to 16.1 s per signal. The
# location of a signal is structural; the wait at it is not. Left one drive out
# at a time, the pooled figure moves only between 10.0 s and 13.8 s, and the
# fitted model predicts a held-out drive to 15% where free-flow manages 25%.
# See docs/junction-timing-plan.md §10.
#
# Was 9.5 s / 9.3 s, fitted on 2026-08-15 from the first two drives alone. Six
# more drives moved the signal up and the stop sign down. Note that the interim
# figure the fit reported on 2026-08-24 — 18.7 s per signal — was an artifact:
# `fit_junction_cost.py` was not applying the `parked` flag, so one drive's
# 7.1-minute lunch stop was charged to the signal it parked beside. Held out
# properly, the same six drives say 13.0 s and all eight say 11.5 s.
#
# Give-ways are the one number here that is a judgement rather than a
# measurement — eight drives have met none. Half a stop sign, on the grounds
# that yielding is cheaper than stopping and that charging zero is a known error
# in a known direction. Massachusetts has 839 of them against 17,567 stop signs,
# so the choice moves an ETA by well under a tenth of a percent either way.
CONTROL_SECONDS = {"signal": 11.5, "stop": 8.1, "giveway": 4.7}

# The scenery penalty saturates — past a few minutes-per-km the router has taken
# every detour worth taking — which used to leave the slider's top half handing
# back an identical route. Most of that was really the compressed score scale
# (see RAW_BASE in score.py): with the full 0-10 range in play the penalty
# discriminates enough that a near-linear slider already spreads well.
#
# This was 1.3, on a measurement over four routes that exponents above ~1.5
# "overcorrect, trading the dead top for a dead bottom". That was true and it
# was true *of BETA = 7*: a steep curve weakens every pref below 1.0, so with a
# small BETA it empties the bottom. The two constants trade against each other
# exactly that way, and the sweep above BETA settles both at once — at 8.0 a
# curve of 2.0 leaves the bottom alive (32% of the gain at pref 0.25) and is the
# only setting that gets a real share into the back half of the travel.

# --- Beauty types -----------------------------------------------------------
# The six *tunable* beauty types — the kinds of scenery a driver would actually
# choose between. One row per type:
#     (api name, display label, edge column, default weight)
# The default weight is the calibrated value from score.py's WEIGHTS, so a user
# weight of 1.0 reproduces the original composite score exactly; >1 leans into
# that type, 0 ignores it.
#
# The display labels are mirrored on the client in ios/Sources/Models.swift
# (RouteProps.sceneryBreakdown) — keep the label set in sync.

# Minimum component value for a stretch of road to count toward a beauty type in
# the route summary. It has to sit *below* the smallest partial-credit band any
# component awards, or that band is silently invisible: score.py gives water 0.45
# at 120-350 m and towns 0.5 in a settlement's wider orbit, and the old 0.5
# threshold dropped every metre of the water band — 18% of the network's km — so
# a route hugging a river 200 m away reported "water: 0 mi".
#
# 0.4 rather than exactly 0.45, because graph.py averages components over an
# edge's length: a stretch that is mostly-but-not-entirely in the band lands
# just under it. The cost of the margin is that `hills`, the one component
# that is continuous rather than banded, now counts 40 m of local relief
# instead of 50 m (25.9% of the network's km rather than 16.0%). That is a
# taste call either way; the water band being invisible was not.
# `test_breakdown_threshold_admits_every_partial_credit_band` is the tripwire if
# a DIST band in score.py is ever retuned below this.
BREAKDOWN_MIN = 0.4

# `c_forest` is blended, not banded: 0.5 * (OSM green polygon) + 0.5 * (measured
# tree fraction). An OSM polygon on its own scores 0.5 and still clears
# BREAKDOWN_MIN, so nothing that counted as green before stops counting — but a
# road through genuinely wooded land that OSM never drew a polygon around needed
# a tree fraction of 0.8 to clear 0.4, while the router was already steering
# toward it from 0.0 upward through the continuous pref_matrix. 27% of
# Massachusetts road-km has no polygon at all, so that gap showed as
# "forest/park: 0 mi" on routes picked partly *for* their forest — the same
# complaint d9ea612 fixed for water and town. 0.25 is "no polygon, but the
# ~100 m box around the road is majority canopy", which is what the credit is for.

# where the means only manage 6.03 against 1.94.
#
# Lives here rather than in looper.py — where it was defined, and is still
# importable from, for `server/app.py` — because point-to-point routes report

# same thing.
BEAUTIFUL_SCORE = 7.0

# --- A* on the fastest arm --------------------------------------------------
# `route(pref=0)` is an A* rather than the full-graph Dijkstra every other
# search runs, because a Dijkstra with no target early-exit settles all 801,719
# nodes of the New England graph whether the trip is 5.6 km or 314 minutes.
#
# The bound is ALT: travel time to and from a fixed set of landmarks, combined
# through the triangle inequality. Over 12 OD pairs spanning New England, 16 of
# them let A* settle 1.9% of the graph at the median. The count is what chose
# 16: docs/astar-fastest-arm.md measured 8 landmarks at 3.8% and 1.6x
# worse on the two hardest pairs, and a straight-line bound at 9.0% and up to
# 48% — which is why the straight-line version is not the cheap one to build
# first but the one that does not work.
#
# Sixteen costs 32 Dijkstras at load and 103 MB of float32 table. Measured on
# New England, against the same load without them: 22.6 s -> 32.1 s, and peak
# RSS 4.56 GB -> 4.66 GB, which is the 2.4% the plan budgeted for.
#
# **Why one landmark set is correct for every request.** `_weights` is
# `d_minutes` plus strictly non-negative addends, so `w >= d_minutes` pointwise
# for every pref, every beauty-weight vector, every `avoid_unpaved` and every
# date, a seasonal closure's +inf being one more such addend. A bound
# on travel time is therefore a bound on every metric this router can be asked
# for, and the tables depend on no user parameter. Only the fastest arm uses
# them — see `route` — but they would be *admissible* on any of them.
ALT_LANDMARKS = 16

# Slack subtracted from every bound, in minutes, to absorb float32 rounding.
# The tables are float32 (103 MB; float64 would be 205 MB) and the bound is a
# *difference* of two stored values, so rounding to nearest can put it above
# the truth. The graph's longest finite distance is 813 minutes, where a
# float32 ulp is 6.1e-5 min, which caps the total error — two stored values
# plus the subtraction — at about 1.5e-4 min. This is a 6x margin over that.
#
# Erring downward, always. An inadmissible bound is the one failure here with
# no symptom: it returns a wrong route that looks entirely right. A slack of
# 1e-3 min is 60 ms of driving, which no ETA in this app can express.
ALT_SLACK_MIN = 1e-3

# Stand-in for "no path" in the landmark tables, in minutes. The New England
# graph is not strongly connected — per landmark, 206 nodes cannot be reached
# from it and 2 cannot reach it — and `inf - inf` is `nan`, which compares
# false against everything and would silently switch the bound off. A finite
# sentinel gives both cases the right answer instead: sentinel minus a real
# distance is a huge bound, which correctly prunes a node that provably cannot
# reach the target at all, and sentinel minus sentinel is 0, which is no
# information and is safe. Far above the 813-minute longest real distance.
ALT_UNREACHABLE_MIN = 1e6

# How much of the graph `_astar` may settle before it gives up and lets the
# whole-graph Dijkstra have the query. A* is a bet that the search is small,
# and the bet does lose: a destination in the corner of Maine, or one that no
# road reaches at all, walks most of the graph through a Python heap and
# finishes several times *slower* than scipy's C would have.
#
# Set at the break-even point, which is the only defensible place for it: past
# here the A* has already spent what the Dijkstra would have cost, so it is no
# longer risking anything it could win. Measured at 1.5-2.0 us per settled node
# against a 277-304 ms whole-graph Dijkstra over 801,719 nodes, which puts
# break-even at 16-23% of the graph depending on the sample. Held as a
# *fraction* because both sides of that division scale with the node count, so
# the figure carries to a graph of another size.
#
# What it costs when it fires, measured over 250 uniformly random OD pairs: it
# fired on 22 of them, and the slowest whole arm was 630 ms against the old
# arm's slowest 787 ms. Over 250 pairs at realistic trip lengths it fired on
# none. The bet is bounded on both sides — a query that gives up pays about
# twice the old arm, and no query A* would have won is refused.

# --- Seasonal closures --------------------------------------------------------
# The roads OSM marks closed or unmaintained in winter, read from

# and `_astar` never improves a distance with. The ALT bound stays admissible,

        first — arriving at a junction, it knows only where it is. Measured
        2026-08-15, that cost 7 of 40 random long Massachusetts routes at least
        one movement the map explicitly forbids.

        The textbook fix is to edge-expand the whole graph: every directed edge
        becomes a node and every turn an edge. That is ruled out here — it
        roughly triples E on a router whose latency scales as E^1.20. But the
        restrictions are sparse, so only the junctions that carry one need
        splitting, and the other 300,000-odd nodes are left exactly as they are.

        For a junction V and an approach `s` that forbids something, a copy of V
        is made, `s` is pointed at the copy instead, and the copy is given only
        the exits `s` is allowed to take. A driver arriving any other way still
        arrives at V itself and can still go anywhere, which is what makes this
        cheap: V keeps its own edges and is still a perfectly good place to
        start a route from.

        **The ordering below is load-bearing.** Every approach is redirected
        before any copy is given its exits, so that a copy's exits inherit the
        redirected head rather than the original node. Done the other way round,
        a driver who reached V through a restricted approach would leave along a
        *duplicate* edge — one that no restriction is keyed to — and evade the
        restriction at the *next* junction along. That is a bug that only shows

        Two graph vintages. One built since 2026-08-29 carries `unpaved_frac`
        and a `score_adj` that is road class alone, and there is nothing to do.
        One built before it folded `LEGACY_UNPAVED_ADJ` into `score_adj` and
        kept no surface column at all — and re-deriving it there is worth the
        twenty lines, because `data/processed-ne` is 364 MB behind a home

        **The recovery is exact, not an estimate.** `CLASS_ADJ` is a pure
        function of `highway`, which is on every edge, and the old `score_adj`
        was exactly `class_adj + LEGACY_UNPAVED_ADJ * unpaved` — so the residual
        over that constant *is* the fraction, and subtracting it back off leaves
        the class term. Measured on all 998,252 edges of the New England build:
        none outside [0, 1], 94.6% exactly 0 and 5.4% exactly 1 with **nothing
        in between**, per-class shares within 0.2 pp of the `surface` tags in
        `scored_chunks.parquet`. The nearest-chunk join in `graph.py` can in
        principle hand an edge a neighbouring way's `score_adj`, which would
        land off those two values; on this build it never does.

        Fragile in one specific way, which is why `graph.py` now writes the
        column properly: this holds only while `score_adj` is exactly
        `class_adj` plus a surface term. A third addend would corrupt it
        silently, so the clip is a guard rail rather than decoration — and the

        Finds the nearest road *segment* first, then takes one of that segment's
        two ends — rather than going straight to the nearest junction. The
        difference is not cosmetic. Graph nodes are junctions, and a house
        mid-block is routinely closer, in a straight line, to a junction on the
        street behind it than to either end of its own street. Snapping to the
        nearest junction outright therefore started 23% of sampled residential
        addresses on a road the driver was not on (measured over 400 blocks; the
        drivers' complaint was "it starts me on a different road than I live
        on"). Going via the segment makes that 0%: both ends of the nearest
        segment are, by construction, on the road you are standing on.

        Which end depends on whether the caller knows where the driver is
        pointing. Planning a trip from a parked car, there is no travel
        direction and the *nearer* end is right. Mid-drive there is, and the
        nearer end is as often as not the junction just passed — so a reroute

        way they came, which the first test drive did in fact do. Given
        `heading` (course over ground in degrees, 0=N, clockwise) the end that
        lies more nearly *ahead* is chosen instead.

        Pass `heading` only while actually moving. CoreLocation reports a course
        of -1 when it has no opinion and its course is noise at walking pace; a
        confidently wrong heading is worse here than none, because it points the

        which way the car is already pointing.

        "Head southeast on Bedford Street" is the right thing to say to a parked
        driver and useless to a moving one. A reroute is computed from where the
        car is *now*, and the road back to the destination is often the way it
        came — so the opening instruction is routinely a turn, and phrasing it
        as a compass heading leaves the driver no way to know they have to act.

        Measured on the drives of 2026-08-22: across two drives, 15 of 27
        reroutes opened against the driver's own course by more than 90 degrees
        and 9 of them by more than 175 — a U-turn, announced as "Head southeast
        on The Great Road" to a car doing 70 km/h northwest. The driver kept
        going, went off the new route within four seconds, and the reroute fired
        again. Ten times in 160 seconds on one drive.

        `start_heading` is only ever set when the caller sent one, which the app
        does only while actually moving (see `usableHeading` in
        NavigationModel.swift), so a trip planned from a standstill still gets
        the compass form. Below `DEPART_TURN_DEGREES` it gets it too: the route
        opens along the road the car is on, and naming the compass direction
        there is both true and less fussy than "Continue".

        The wire vocabulary is unchanged — `turn` plus an existing modifier, as
        OSRM would send it — so a client built before this renders it correctly
        with no update.
