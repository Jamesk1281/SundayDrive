"""The drive-trace analysis: does a recorded drive give back the right numbers?

These matter more than most tests here because the input costs a drive. If the
analysis quietly mis-reads a trace, the answer is a plausible-looking speed
factor fitted to a bug, and the only way to find out is to drive again.

Traces are built here rather than fixtured from a file, so each test states the
drive it is describing — 20 m/s for 10 s, one 30-second stop — and the expected
output is arithmetic the reader can do in their head.
