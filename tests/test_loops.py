"""Loop-route tests: the tree accumulation (exact) and real loops over the graph.

The accumulation test comes first on purpose. Everything in `looper.py` rests on
recovering the km and scenic-km of a path from a Dijkstra predecessor tree
instead of re-running a search, and if that arithmetic is wrong every other
number the module produces is quietly wrong with it. `route()` is the
independent instrument: it walks the same edges the slow way.

The rest assert what a driver would notice — the loop comes back to where it
started, it does not drive the same road twice, it is roughly the length that was
asked for, and a start on a cul-de-sac still gets an answer.

These need the built graph and skip without it, like tests/test_routing.py.
